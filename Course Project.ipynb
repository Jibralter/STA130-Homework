    "How Often Do You Get Sick --> Physically Distance? Socialize Only Indoor? Avoid Non-Essential Trips?\n",
    "Idea: For people that rarely or never get sick, are those the people who are always following COVID guidelines strictly. OR, is it that those people have good immune systems, and since they don't get sick often they are more relaxed with going outside?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Playing Games with Other People --> Played A Board Game with Others? Visiting Friends\n",
    "Idea: For people that play computer games, are those same people playing board games in person? Visited friends at their home? I would imagine many people (including myself) would assume that those playing games are taking away that time from socializing in person, but is that really true? Do these individuals just priortize socializing more?\n",

    "Do people with a large number of friends/close friends also feel like they have plenty of people they can trust? Does a large number of friends imply and a large number of people to trust, or does a smaller number of friends imply a stronger relationship between each person and by extension a better feeling of people they can trust? Can both be true? Are both true? Do people that don't feel like there are people they can trust have a common trait?"

    "Analysis 1:\n",
    "Independent Variable = WELLNESS_malach_pines_burnout_measure_sick (i.e. How often do you feel weak/sick)\n",

    "\n",
    "How will this analysis be conducted?\n",
    "First, if an individual has a NaN in any of the variables above, we will not consider them.\n",
    "Observe that each of the dependent variables has the same options in the given question. Those options being:\n",
    "Very Closely, Somewhat Closely and Not At All. \n",
    "We will create a simple system to determine how strictly an individual followed covid guidelines.\n",
    "For each variable, if the participant chose \"Very Closely\" they'll be assigned a score of 3.\n",
    "If the participant chose \"Somewhat Closely\" they'll be assigned a score of 2\n",
    "If the participant chose \"Not At All\" they'll be assigned a score of 1.\n",
    "Then the scores of all scores will be added up to get a final score, a high score represents strictly following the guidelines, and a low score represents loosely following guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we will also place a score on our independent variable:\n",
    "Never = 1\n",
    "Almost Never = 2\n",
    "Rarely = 3\n",
    "Sometimes = 4\n",
    "Often = 5\n",
    "Very Often = 6\n",
    "Always = 7\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now plot the values. For all the people who chose never, they're x value will be 1 and the y. value will be the total score of the Covid guidelines based on the system we earlier defined. Similarilr, for people who chose almost never will have an x value of 2 and the corresponding total score. This process will continue for x values from 1-7. After that, we can generate a fitted linear regression to determine the relationship between feeling's of sickness/weakness and strictly following Covid-19 guidelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible Results:\n",
    "I suspect that the results will indicate that those who often (or more than often) feel sick/weak will be the ones who strictly follow Covid 19 guidelines. While one may expect that those who feel sick often stems from their lack of certain hygenic rules or a high exposure to germs while outside their household, it's possible this isn't the case. I'd make the hypothesis that those who feel sick more often will be the ones to strictly follow the guidelines, as their susceptibility to being sick provides more incentive to avoid possible Covid exposure. Moreover, those who rarely feel sick will have less incentive to avoid possible Covid exposure, as their immune system is good enough such that any basic amount of exposure will leave them with little to no symptoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is this helpful?\n",
    "This provides useful information as to who followed the guidelines and a possible reason as to why. Covid guidelines simulated far more rigorous hygenic guidelines in order to avoid the spread of germs, and so this data could represent how those who still follow rigorous hygenic guidelines get sick more often than those who don't, which one can consider a contradiction to the typical standard."

    "Variables: LONELY_direct, CONNECTION_social_num_close_friends_grouped\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on CONNECTION_social_num_close_friends_grouped, we can determine how many close friends an individual friend has. From there we can determine if there's a relationship with loneliness during the past week.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stems from an interest of whether more close friends does actually help an individual feel less lonely, intuitively that makes sense but does the data back that up?\n",
    "\n",
    "This would be a simple analysis, we will first ignore any participants that have a NaN in either entry of the variables being analyzed. Next we will use a stacked bar plot to represent the number of people in each category with respect to the number of close friends. Each category of the stacked bar plot would correspond to a category in LONELY_direct, while each \"stack\" would represents the number of indicated close friends.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would suspect this demonstrates that feelings of loneliness stem from a lower number of close friends. Having a lower number of close friends would logically mean that the opportunity to spend time with people is also lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is relevant as it would either solidify that loneliness has a direct relationship to a number of close friends, or it would demonstrate that there is no relationship between the two, implying that while loneliness by definition does indicate an excess of being alone, the number of close friends one has does not have enough of an effect for it to cause a significant impact on feelings of loneliness."

    "\n",
    "This analysis will be simple, similarly following the same analysis previously. It would involve a stacked bar plot that has the categories of playing video games, and each stack as one of the options for how often an individual visits a friend's house in the past three months.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results will likely display how a large number of people who play video games visit their friend's houses less often than those who don't play/play very little. This follows off the logical assumption that spending time playing video games takes away free time that could be spent socializing in person at a friend's house.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results do have use as it could encourage more in person socialization rather than digital socializing. These results could be used in combination with the possible overall mental state of people who play video games vs. those who don't to show how video games can have a positive or negative effect on an individual's mental health."
